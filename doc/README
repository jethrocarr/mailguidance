MAILGUIDANCE
============

MailGuidance is an AGPL web interface for generating procmail rulesets designed
for organisations wanting to reliability distribute emails from automated
systems to various staff.


To use MailGuidance, setup one email account to receive your alerts and support
emails - such as Nagios, Logwatch, server errors, or potentially even customer
enquiries (using domain filters). 

MailGuidance then provides an interface for creating rules for how the emails
should be handled with various options such as subject and sender filters. When
emails match a specific rule, they get delivered (using Procmail) to the assigned
user.

If the user is on leave, they can mark their holiday status in the web interface
and MailGuidance will redirect their messages to another user, so that nothing
gets forgotten about or dropped. 

If no rules match, the email gets distributed to all users so that it doesn't
get ignored or missed by a catch all box.
